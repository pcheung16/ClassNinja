# ClassNinja
A site for sharing notes and other things with classmates.

## What is it?

A place to share notes and ask questions about any class you are in, anonymously. The site is
built for college classes to give students a place where they can ask anything they want
without worry about being identified.

## How do I get started?

Simply go to the page for your class and get started with your posts as well as replying to others.

Posts have id's to enable replies but posters do not need to sign up.
